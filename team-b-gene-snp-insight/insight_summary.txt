rs429358 Insight Summary (as of 2025-11-24)
===========================================================
Entity: rs429358 (APOE) — dbSNP ID: rs429358

Aliases / HGVS
- Gene: APOE (Entrez Gene ID: 348)
- Protein change (common numbering): p.Cys112Arg (C112R); RefSeq isoform numbering: p.Cys130Arg
- Representative transcript: NM_000041.4:c.388T>C

Functional role (gene-level context)
- APOE encodes apolipoprotein E, a major apolipoprotein involved in lipid transport and the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins; it plays roles in neuronal lipid trafficking and injury response.
- rs429358 is a missense variant in exon 4 of APOE that, together with rs7412, defines the APOE ε haplotypes (ε2, ε3, ε4). The C allele at rs429358 is part of the ε4 haplotype.

Disease/trait associations (selected, not exhaustive)
- Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD): the ε4 haplotype (which includes the rs429358 C allele) is a well-established genetic risk factor; risk increases in a dose-dependent manner (e.g., e3/e4 < e4/e4).
- Lipid traits and cardiovascular risk: APOE variation influences plasma lipids and related disorders; clinical impact depends on haplotype background and other factors.

Known clinical records / examples
1) ClinVar records for NM_000041.4:c.388T>C (p.Cys130Arg)
   - Multiple submissions link this variant (rs429358) to Alzheimer disease and other phenotypes; interpretations vary across submitters and contexts.
   - Example accessions: RCV000019448 (Alzheimer disease 2), RCV000991302 (Alzheimer disease), RCV001262791 (lipoprotein-related phenotype).

Genotype/haplotype notes
- ε haplotypes are defined by rs429358 and rs7412:
  • ε3: rs429358=T and rs7412=C
  • ε4: rs429358=C and rs7412=C
  • ε2: rs429358=T and rs7412=T
- Clinical interpretation and risk counseling should consider full ε haplotype (both SNPs), ancestry, family history, and non-genetic factors.
